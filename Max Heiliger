The Hidden Network: Nazi Middlemen and the Legacy of Plundered Wealth

By Tina Krause, The Atlantic/ICIJ/OpenSource

---

In the waning days of the Third Reich, high-ranking Nazi officials devised elaborate schemes to safeguard billions in assets they had plundered from across occupied Europe. As the Allies closed in, a network of financiers, aristocrats, and industrialists took steps to hide the fortune, weaving it into complex webs of bank accounts, front companies, and trusts. Among the most vital players in this network were the middlemen—wealthy, well-connected individuals with the means to convert ill-gotten Nazi wealth into legitimate assets beyond Germany's borders. 

One of the primary conduits for these funds was a clandestine financial pipeline known as the "Max Heiliger" accounts, a set of repositories that converted Nazi wealth into Swiss francs and other foreign currencies. The account names—innocuous, even saintly—belied a vast system of organized deception, designed to shield Nazi assets from confiscation.

This investigation delves into the role of prominent financiers and industrialists like the von Saxe family and Friedrich Flick, who, as middlemen, helped mask Nazi plunder behind layers of international respectability, preserving it through decades of post-war prosperity.  

The Role of the "Max Heiliger" Accounts: Building a Fortress of Nazi Wealth

The "Max Heiliger" accounts were initially established as financial reserves for the SS and other Nazi agencies such as the RSHA (Reich Main Security Office) and the WVHA (Economic and Administrative Main Office). These accounts were funded by the Reinhard Fund, named after SS leader Reinhard Heydrich, and represented the spoils of Nazi conquests: gold, cash, and other valuables seized from victims of the Holocaust. As these funds accumulated, middlemen like Helmut von Saxe and Friedrich Flick became essential in managing, laundering, and relocating assets out of Germany.

Helmut von Saxe, an aristocratic German financier, leveraged his family’s financial influence to secure Nazi assets through Swiss banks. According to documents found in Swiss and German archives, von Saxe was recruited by SS head Heinrich Himmler to orchestrate the movement of gold and currency across borders, sheltering Nazi funds in Swiss bank accounts that were difficult to trace. Acting as a quiet intermediary, von Saxe reportedly arranged for large deposits to be funneled into the Swiss National Bank and private Zurich banks, using bribes to facilitate transactions amid increasing Allied scrutiny.

Friedrich Flick, a prominent industrialist and one of Germany’s wealthiest men, played a similar role, albeit on a larger and more openly complicit scale. Flick’s wealth came from arms production and the exploitation of forced labor from concentration camps. Flick’s companies benefitted directly from the plundering of conquered territories, and he was adept at placing Nazi-backed assets into foreign holdings that would endure long after the war. His empire, which controlled a vast portion of German industry, provided a network of corporations through which Nazi funds could be laundered and distributed globally.

Swiss Connections: Hiding in Plain Sight

In Switzerland,Helmut von Saxe formed alliances with Swiss bankers like Alfred Hirs, head of Department III at the Swiss National Bank, who succeeded Rudolf Schnorf in 1942. This department, which managed foreign funds, was integral to Nazi financial operations. Hirs initially hesitated to continue accepting Nazi gold deposits, but von Saxe, asserting both political and financial leverage, persuaded Hirs to maintain the arrangement, even as Nazi defeat became a foregone conclusion.

Documents released by Swiss authorities reveal a steady stream of communications between Hirs and von Saxe regarding the covert transfer of Nazi assets. By 1944, as Switzerland became a refuge for Nazi wealth, Hirs described to his Bank Committee a "veritable flood of gold" from German sources. Von Saxe had, by that time, established a network of Swiss accounts under false identities, some connected to Flick’s corporations, which ensured the assets remained shielded.

Flick’s strategy included not only laundering funds but also embedding Nazi assets within major industrial concerns in post-war Europe. By reinvesting plundered wealth into foreign affiliates and dummy corporations, Flick created a vast empire of industrial assets, while von Saxe focused on liquidating gold and cash through Swiss intermediaries. Both men capitalized on the complex banking secrecy laws in Switzerland, effectively creating untraceable fortunes.

Flick’s Post-War Survival and the New Empire

Helmut von Saxe’s post-war fate remains shrouded in mystery, Flick’s resilience in the years following Germany’s surrender is a testament to the enduring power of Nazi middlemen. Arrested for his role in supporting the Nazi regime, Flick was convicted at the Nuremberg trials and sentenced to seven years in prison. However, his vast wealth and industrial assets were preserved, with family and loyal allies managing his businesses in his absence.

Remarkably, Flick returned to public life in the 1950s and regained control of his empire, becoming one of Germany’s wealthiest men once again. His continued success is emblematic of how the Nazi financial legacy outlived the regime itself, supported by hidden wealth channels established during the war. Flick’s story epitomizes the moral ambiguity surrounding former Nazi collaborators who, despite their complicity, were able to thrive and influence post-war Europe.

A Legacy Concealed: The Modern Implications of Nazi Wealth

The legacy of von Saxe, Flick, and other Nazi middlemen has implications far beyond the historical narrative. By embedding Nazi assets in foreign industries and financial institutions, these intermediaries ensured that Nazi wealth would not only survive the war but continue to grow. The economic powerhouse that West Germany became in the decades after World War II owed much to industrialists like Flick and financiers like von Saxe, who helped secure and expand the plundered wealth that laid the foundation for post-war prosperity.

For descendants and heirs of these men, the past is often a guarded secret. Many have publicly distanced themselves from the wartime activities of their forebears, yet they continue to benefit from the fortunes forged in the shadows of the Third Reich. As Swiss and German archives yield more information, calls for accountability—whether through reparations or public acknowledgment—grow louder. However, legal and political limitations remain significant obstacles, leaving the legacy of Nazi wealth unresolved.

A Lingering Legacy: Today’s Beneficiaries of Nazi Wealth

As historical documents continue to surface, shedding light on the shadow economies that sustained Nazi regimes, one question remains: what happens when the beneficiaries of this hidden wealth are no longer the direct perpetrators, but their descendants—some of whom continue to enjoy the fruits of these past dealings?

The complex web of Nazi-financed fortunes is not easily unraveled. Among the families whose wealth is linked to these covert transactions are the Flicks, the Reimanns, and the von Saxes. These families became embroiled in financial schemes that would leave their descendants in possession of vast fortunes long after the fall of the Third Reich.

The Flick family, for instance, whose patriarch Friedrich Flick helped construct one of the largest industrial empires in post-war Germany, has long been associated with wartime profiteering and the exploitation of forced labor. Despite facing reparations and international scrutiny, the family’s wealth has remained remarkably intact, stretching into modern times through a diversified business empire. Similarly, the Reimanns, whose companies control global brands like Keurig and Krispy Kreme, have only recently been forced to confront their ties to Nazi-era profiteering.

The von Saxe family, whose role in laundering Nazi wealth through Swiss accounts has only come to light recently, stands as one of the more enigmatic examples of such wartime fortunes. Though Ludo von Saxe, the current head of the family, has been unwilling to comment on his family’s past, documents suggest his grandfather, Helmut von Saxe, was heavily involved in the clandestine movement of Nazi funds. Helmut's skill in navigating the complex network of Swiss banking allowed Nazi assets to be converted into legitimate foreign currency, securing his family a fortune that has remained largely protected from scrutiny, perhaps due to their commitment to discretion and secrecy.
